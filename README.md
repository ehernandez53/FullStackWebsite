The project is hosted on: http://ecs.fullerton.edu/~cs349s12/

I created a website for my friend, Melanie, who's an artist. She provided me with some of her work to create the site.
The web site serves the purpose of both showcasing her artwork and allowing visitors to the site to leave critiques on
each piece. These critiques are submitted through a form and saved to a Firebase database. On every page for each
piece, past comments that have been left (those stored in the database) on the piece are displayed.

There is no installation or configuration of any kind required.
